# The Spectrogram - Training_Data - Subspace_detection repository

## This repo is an exploration into calculating and plotting spectrograms with python. It also looks into synthesizing seismic training data for machine learning models. Additionally, it is a deep investigation into creating subspace detectors using eqcorrscan. To test out the notebook for yourself, clone the repo along with all the neccessarry data. 

Geophysics Rocks! :)
